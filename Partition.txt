Create and use partitions 
Create /home/admin/ansible/partition.yaml, which will create partitions on manage nodes:
- After sdb creating a 1000M primary partition, partition number 1, and format ext4
- prod group to permanently mount the partition to /data
- If there is not enough space, give promt information
"Could not create partition of that size"
- create 500M partition
- If sdb does not exist, a promt message will be given 
"this disk is not exist"
